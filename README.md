An AI-driven **Conversational RAG Chatbot** designed and deployed for [Tattva Shanti](https://tattvashanti.com/),  
an organisation offering a range of wellness and business support services.  
The chatbot is trained specifically on their **Life Coaching**, **Professional/Startup Coaching**, and **EIR (Entrepreneur-in-Residence)** programs,  
delivering human-like, context-aware assistance directly on their WordPress website.

## Overview

The **Tattva Shanti Chatbot** acts as a virtual assistant that:
- Understands user intent and provides conversational, human-like responses.
- Restricts its domain knowledge to three key topics:
  1. Life Coaching  
  2. Professional/Startup Coaching  
  3. Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) Program  
- Integrates AI retrieval from curated and embedded content.
- Automates data logging to Google Sheets via n8n workflows.

From data to deployment, it combines **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, **Pinecone**, and **n8n**  
to maintain session context, perform real-time retrieval, and provide reliable automation through a secure backend.

## Core AI Architecture

### 1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Cleaned and structured domain-specific data (scraped & manually enriched with metadata).
- Embedded text using **OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small`** model.
- Stored vector representations in **Pinecone Vector Database**.
- Real-time retrieval of top-k contextually relevant documents per query.

### 2. **Generative Layer**
- Used **OpenAI’s `gpt-3.5-turbo`** for controlled, domain-constrained response generation.
- A **custom system prompt** ensures:
  - Warm, professional tone.
  - Context-limited knowledge.
  - Boundary management for irrelevant or restricted topics (e.g., medical, contact info).

### 3. **Automated Logging & Analytics**
- Every query-response pair is **sent via webhook to n8n**, which:
  - Logs chat data into **Google Sheets** for analytics.
  - Enables further automation, such as feedback tracking and engagement metrics.
